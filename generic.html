									<h2>Self in Western and Eastern Thoughts</h2>
									
									<p>One of the most effective ways to learn about oneself is by 
									taking seriously the cultures of others. It forces you to pay 
									attention to those details of life which differentiate them from 
									you.” - <b>Edward T. Hall</b></p>
									<p style="text-align:left;"><b>CONCEPT OF SELF</b> - There are a lot of sources in which we can analyze the perspective of 
									each culture and country about the concept of the “self.” 
									<br><b>Literature</b> - like how one depicts a hero or villain in their stories in different countries, like USA, China, Korea, etc.
									<br><b>Socialization</b>- like how they see their boss or their subordinate.
									<br><b>Artworks, Dances, Even Clothing</b>- This thing may show us clues about the Self.
									<br><b>Cultural Diversity</b>
										<br>▪ Put themselves first
										<br>▪ Dedicated to independent thinking and self-reliance
										<br>▪ Distant to the feelings of others
										<br>▪ Preserving, and success of the group is more important
										<br>▪ Paying attention to the needs and feelings of each member of the group
										<br>▪ Sensitive with the feelings of the members of the group to each other </p>
										

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>WESTERN THOUGHTS</b> 
										<br>▪ They give higher value with their personal rights.
										<br>▪ The western society is trying to find and prove the "truth."
										<br><b>WESTERNERS</b>-emphasize more on the value of 
										equality even if they see that the individual can 
										rise above everything else. Ex:<b>Westerners</b> would most likely to call their 
										bosses, parents, or other seniors by their first 
										name. The boss can also be approached head-on 
										when conflicts or problems about him arises.

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>ESTERN THOUGHTS</b>
										<br>▪ Giving more value to social responsibility and accepting the reality of life (fact) and 
											interested in maintaining the balance of life. 
										<br><b>EASTERNERS</b> with their collectivistic culture, put 
										more emphasis on hierarchy as the culture 
										wants to keep things in harmony and order (Qingxue, 2003). Ex: For <b>Asians</b>, we have respectful terms for our seniors and a lot of workers would not dare go against the high-ranking officials.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>CONFUCIANISM</b>
										<br> Also known as <b>RUISM</b>, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a humanistic or rationalistic 
										religion which was developed from the teachings of the <b> Chinese philosopher CONFUCIUS</b> (1551-479 BCE) who considered himself a re-codifier and re-transmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang and Zhou dynasty. It is focused on having a <b>harmonious social life</b>. Identity and self-concept of the individual are interwoven with the identity and status of his/her community or culture, sharing its
										pride as well as its failures.

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>TAOISM</b>
										<br>Also known as <b>Daoism</b>. A Chinese philosophy based on the writings of <b>Lao-tzu</b> (6th century BC) advocating humility and religious piety. It is living in the way of the TAO or the UNIVERSE. It is a simple lifestyle and its teachings. It aims to describe how to attain life. The self is part of the universe.
								        <br><b>The 3 Treasures or 3 Jewels</b> - (3 ESSENTIAL ENERGIES SUSTAINING HUMAN LIFE):
										<br>▪<b>Jing</b> – “essence”
										<br>▪<b>Qi</b> – “energy”
										<br>▪<b>Shen</b> – “spirit”

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>BUDDHISM</b> 
										<br>It is an Indian religion. All Buddhist traditions share the GOAL OF OVERCOMING SUFFERING AND THE CYCLE OF DEATH & REBIRTH, either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood.

										<br><b>3 Marks of Existence:</b>
										<br><b>1. Impermanence (anicca)</b>- all things are in constant state of flux; nothing lasts, and everything decays.
										<br><b>2. Suffering (dukkha)</b> - all things are not experienced; everything is conditioned and conditioning.
										<br><b>3. Non-Self (anatta)</b> - denies that there is anything called a “SELF”. 
										<br>Gautama Buddha taught that all beings conditioned by causes (sankhara) are impermanent (anicca) and suffering (dukhha), and that not-self(anatta) characterizes all dhammas, meaning THERE IS NO “I”, “ME” or “MINE” in either the conditioned or the unconditioned (i.e. nibbana). 

									<h2>Spiritual Self</h2>
									<p> The spiritual self is the most intimate, inner subjective part of self. It is the most intimate version of the self because of the satisfaction experienced when thinking of one's ability to argue and discriminate, of one's moral sensibility and conscience, and of our unconquerable will ( James 1890) is purer than all other sentiments of satisfaction(Green 1997).</p>

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>RITUAL</b>
										<br>- the performance of ceremonial acts prescribed by a tradition or sacred law (Britannica 2017). Ritual is a specific, observable mode of behavior exhibited by all known societies. It is thus possible to view ritual as a way of defining or describing humans. </p>

									<p> There are three fundamental characteristics of rituals according to Penner (Britannica 2017). Ritual has the characteristics of:
									<br>1. A feeling or emotion of respect, awe, fascination, or dread in relation to the sacred.
									<br>2. Dependence upon a belief system that is usually expressed in the language of myth.
									<br>3. Is symbolic in relation to its reference.

									<h3>SOME WORLD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES</h3>
									<h2></h2>
									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>CHRISTIANITY</b>
										<br><b>Beliefs</b> - Christians believe in Trinitarian God. One God in three personas: God the Father (Creator), God the Son (Savior), and God the Holy - Spirit. Eternal life after death will be achieved through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is, God the Son, who came into flesh, to spread the Good News of Salvation. He died on the cross for the sin of the humanity but resurrected from the death, so that anyone who believes in Him will be saved and have eternal life. The Holy Bible is a selection of books, which is divided into two, the Old Testament and New Testament. 
										<br><b>Customs and Practices</b> - - Sacrament of Baptism and Sacrament of Communion are practiced by Christian churches. The Sacrament of Baptism symbolizes the birth in Christian World, while the Sacrament of Communion is an act of remembrance of Jesus Christ's sacrificial love. Jesus Christ teaching in unconditional love that is expressed in loving the poor, oppressed, and outcast of the society.
										<br>Christmas and Resurrection (Easter) are the two major celebrations in Christianity. Christmas, usually on December 25, commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ while Resurrection Sunday (depends on the lunar calendar, sometime in March or April) celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from death.

									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>BUDDHISM</b>
										<br><b>Beliefs</b> - Buddhism believes that life is not a bed of roses. Instead, there are suffering, pain, and frustrations. When people suffer, they want to experience the goodness of life and avoiddisappointments. It becomes a habit known as the reactive cycle of wanting and hating, like and dislike, and craving and aversion. This reactive cycle can be broken through the practice of mediation, acquiring more wisdom and deeper understanding, and acceptance of things as they are.
										<br><b>Customs and Practices</b> - There are two types of meditation practices: samatha and vipassana. Samatha is practiced as mindfulness of breathing and development of loving- kindness (Metta Bhavana). Vipassana practices aim at developing into reality. Acquiring wisdom is by studying Buddha's teaching, the Dharma. Through the reflection of Dharma, Buddhists can achieve a deeper understanding of life. 
										<br><b>Buddhist believe in non-violence principle</b> - Some of the major Buddhist celebrations are Parinirvana Day in February; Buddha Day (Wesak) in May; Dharma Day in July: Padmasambhava Day in October; and Sangha Day in November. 
									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>HINDUISM</b>
										<br><b>Beliefs</b> - Hinduism covers a wide range of traditional beliefs and religious groups; thus, there is no single founder or leader. Hindus believe that existence is a cycle of birth, death and rebirth, governed by Karma. Karma is a concept where the reincarnated life will depend on how the past life was spent. Hindus believe that the soul passes through a cycle of successive lives and its next incarnation is always dependent on how the previous life was lived. Vedas are sacred scriptures of Hindus. Mahabharata and Ramayana are two other important texts of the Hindus.
										<br><b>Customs and Practices</b> - Diwali, and Navrati are the most celebrated festivals of the Hindus. Diwali is the Festival of Lights while Navrati is the festival of nine nights, which celebrate the triumph of good over evil. Hindus have set dates to honor particular manifestations of God. 
									<p style="text-align: left;"><b>ISLAM</b>
										<br><b>Beliefs</b> - - Muslims believe in Allah, who is their "One God." They believed in the unity and universality of God. Muslims also have a strong sense of community or "ummah" and an awareness of their solidarity with all Muslims worldwide. Islam means 'willing submission to God."Muslims believe that Mohammed is the last and final prophet sent by God. Mohammed was born in Mecca in 570 CE and received revelations from God through the Angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The Holy Book of Islam is called the Quran, which was taught to be recited in Arabic because any translation is seen as inadequate.
